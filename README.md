# Experiment with the PixiJS Creation Engine

I am learning [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) in this project.

## Thanks

Many thanks to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=experiment-with-pixijs) who provide
an [Open Source License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/) for this project ❤️.

## Developer Guide

To run the application, host its files on a local HTTP server:

```shell
npx browser-sync start --server --files "*.html, *.js"
```

Your browser should automatically open http://localhost:3000 and refresh every time you change an HTML or JavaScript
file.
